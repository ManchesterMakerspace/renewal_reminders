# Renewal reminder scheduler

This is a cron job to remind makerspace members that they might need to renew soon

Runs once everyday

### Makerspace Contributors

Note: Changes deploy on push to master branch

Requires installing/running mongod, node, and npm. Can also require a slack webhook URIs as that is its intended target output. Though without it things can be tested by falling back on logs

For Manchester Makerspace members reach out on the slack #access_control channel if you are interested in working with real data.
